# Hi! :D
![My emotional state](https://external-preview.redd.it/H-vxRPlTiQ5ZhplXvUARgkbzc01EwumZCHsj0WPv1to.jpg?width=640&crop=smart&auto=webp&s=a231a882015041aeceac9f47057ac83cdd2ce692 "Literally me")

## It's me =)
Hi, I’m Beth, a University Student at Singapore Management University studying BSc(Computing and Law)! My daily activities involve waking up and going to sleep. Given my current identity crisis that spawns in every few years, I have to say that I am doing quite well for myself and want to keep it up. I'm a beginner programmer and would be happy to learn from anyone patient enough to sit down with me for a few hours and tell me that you need to put a "." in between "console" and "log". Many thanks for dropping by!

## My shining personality
* **Code that I can write**: Python, Javascript, Lua, PHP, SQL, MongoDB, bits of Svelte, Tailwind and React
* **Code that I like to think I can write**: Solidity, C++
* **Topics of interest**: Web development, Large Language Models, Web3 development (Ethereum), UI UX design, Databases, Motion Capture
* **To learn**: Many more...

## I promise I have a life outside of GitHub
* **Sports**: 
  * Muay Thai
  * Krav Maga (but I am very bad at it)
  * Rock Climbing (I can do a V3 now guys)
  * Cycling
  * Roller skating
* **Arts**:
  * Singing
  * Musical instruments (piano, guitar, drums, ukulele, cajon, otamatone)
  * Digital art
  * 3D modelling
  * Writing (novels, short stories, essays)
* **Other**: 
  * First person shooters (Valorant, Overwatch)
  * Rhythm games (MaiMai, Chunithm, Cytus, Osu!, Project Sekai, Bang! Dream, Dancerush Stardom)
  * Reading Webtoons (:O)

## How can I talk to you more + can we collab?
You can message me on [Telegram](https://t.me/dobesquiddy), hit up my Discord (dobesquiddy), or send me an [email](huitingloke@gmail.com)! I am willing to collaborate on projects that allow me to work with law (contracts, terms etc) and computing (blockchain, frontend) because this course has become my entire personality. I'm also interested in NFT development and have made [my own](https://opensea.io/collection/sadblobs).

## Are you happy?
I finally am!
