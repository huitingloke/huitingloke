- 👋 Hi, I’m Beth, a University Student at Singapore Management University studying BSc(Computing and Law)! 
- 👀 I’m interested in Python, Javascript, HTMl, CSS, and game development~ I really enjoy creating text games and little programs using Python =) I also enjoy teaching it to my friends so I can slowly form a group of coders who will help me debug my messy code.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use external libraries and endure reading documentation, Godot, UI-UX, and will soon start on SQL and PHP (for school)!
- ✨ My hobbies include Muay Thai, Krav Maga, rock climbing and cycling with my friends, drawing, visual design, music and video games!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on nothing in particular yet, but I will keep my options open when interesting projects show up!
- 📫 You can reach me on huitingloke@gmail.com if you want to vibe or ask questions (which I will try my best to answer)!
