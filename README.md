## Clown introduction
Hi, Iâ€™m *Beth*, a University Student at Singapore Management University studying BSc(Computing and Law)! My daily activities involve waking up and going to sleep. Given my current identity crisis-crisis that spawns in every few years, I have to say that I am doing quite well for myself and want to keep it up.

## My shining personality

* **Code that I like to think I can write**: PHP, MySQL, Solidity
* **Topics of interest**: Web development, Web3 development (Ethereum), UI UX design, Databases
* **To learn**: Vue.js, React, C, enjoying reading documentation without wanting to cry for 10 hours straight

## I promise I have a life outside of GitHub
* **Sports**: 
  * Muay Thai
  * Krav Maga (but I am very bad at it)
  * Rock Climbing (see: Krav Maga)
  * Cycling
  * Jogging
* **Arts**:
  * Singing
  * Musical instruments (piano, guitar, drums, ukulele, cajon, otamatone)
  * Digital art
  * 3D modelling
  * Writing (novels, short stories, essays)
* **Other**: 
  * First person shooters (Valorant, Overwatch)
  * Rhythm games (MaiMai, Chunithm, Cytus, Osu!, Project Sekai, Bang! Dream, Dancerush Stardom)
  * Reading Webtoons (Lookism)

## How can I talk to you more + can we collab? UwU
You can message me on [Telegram](https://t.me/dobesquiddy), hit up my Discord (> squiddy <#0771), or send me an [email](huitingloke@gmail.com)! I am willing to collaborate on projects that allow me to work with law (contracts, terms etc) and computing (blockchain, frontend) because this course has become my entire personality. I'm also interested in NFT development and have made [my own](https://opensea.io/collection/sadblobs).

## Are you happy?
No.
